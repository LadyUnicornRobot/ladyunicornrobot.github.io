      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will probably be young to middle-aged adults who have careers and/or children. They are people who are already pretty self-aware and who want to achieve a little more peace in their personal lives through mastering of Self. They take the initiative and love to learn and try new things. They will most likely try out the different activities and then teach them to their children, friends, and loved ones to help them improve their quality of life. Others who may be drawn to the site are people who need a little extra help to supplement professional therapy, or people who can’t afford to see a professional, but still need to be guided through developing theraputic tools.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h3>Daily Practice</h3>
      <p>Set up: Open the mouth, tongue to back of top teeth in an n position.<br>
        Practice: Breathe in slowly through the nose. Relax the base of the throat. Breathe out through the nose. Rest in that space. Let the back of your brain float in the quiet dark. Breathe in through the nose. Rest in hang time for a moment. Open the throat and hum a note that is comfortable and low, with the n sound. Keep the note steady. Notice every time it fluxuates. Hum to the end of your breath, but not to discomfort. Repeat this practice several times.
