      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The primary purpose for this site is to draw customers. It needs to be eye-catching and easy to understand and navigate. It will showcase beautiful photos. It will clearly inform customers about different rafting experiences and pricing. It will provide a quick and easy place for customers to book and pay for a rafting experience. It will inform customers of company policies and incentives. It will link to social media platforms, especially Instagram and Facebook, in order to create a user experience community where people can share their photos and experiences. It will initiate a personal bond between customers and company employees before they’ve even met, by having a page for employee photos and bios. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target customers are young people in their late teens to early 30s who are still in school so they have the summers off. They usually have good enough jobs to pay for fun activities without the demands of a full-time career or family. They are interested in the adrenaline rush that comes from rugged, outdoorsy activities like Jeeping, rock climbing, long-distance running, hiking, and snowboarding. They want to have fun and make memories with their friends; and they also want to capture those memories so they can share them to their social media friends and followers. Target customers are thrill-seekers, so their needs are to constantly have a variety of new experiences. The majority of customers will access this site on their mobile phones.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- You are not required to use this logo for your site…but you must have a logo for your website.  I can offer additional logos to use, or you can create your own-->

        Style Guide

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/1e4f28-ddfa04-4d726f-d9f4c7" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/1e4f28-ddfa04-4d726f-d9f4c7</a></p>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">#1E4F28</td><td class="secondary">#D9F4C7</td><td class="accent1">#DDFA04</td><td class="accent2">#4D726F</td></tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Montserrat Light 300  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this for the heading because it is crisp and clean. The line of the curved letters matches the lines in the logo and evokes the idea of water. The sharp points on letters like A and K evokes mountain peaks, trees, and the other scenery one would find on a rafting trip. It is a lighter font than the body font, creating a visual experience on the site parallel to the physical one someone would have while rafting under a clear, blue sky.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Open Sans Regular 400  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose this for the paragraph text because it has similar lines to the header style, but is more bold and the letters are closer together, adding contrast. It's a clean, sans serif font for easy reading on a mobile device.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
