      <h2>Sarah B.</h2>
      <p>I am very excited to be starting on my journey into the world of coding and web development. I have always been a creative person and find great enjoyment in activities such as knitting, making bread, spinning yarn, drawing, reading, painting, and growing a garden. I am expecting that the creative elements of coding will be right up my alley. I also believe that the skills I gain will be relevant for the rest of my life since technology is such an integral part of work and society, and basic skills in technology seem to be almost as necessary now in the workplace as basic skills in reading and writing.</p>
      <p>My husband and I have been married for four and a half years. We live in Utah, USA and have two little girls. Our baby girl came mid-April 2020, right in the middle of the global pandemic, and we are so blessed to have such a sweet, chunky bundle of joy in our home during such a difficult time. My husband and I both come from families who raised us in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, so we've been familiar with the Church our whole lives. We are so grateful to have the Gospel of Jesus Christ to help us as we raise our children. We find comfort, answers, and assurances of forgiveness as we read the scriptures. I think I find a new favorite scripture every time I read. We've loved seeing our toddler's little testimony grow as we teach her from the Book of Mormon and sing songs from the Children's Songbook. As a family, we love going for walks or drives, singing, reading stories, and watching shows together, especially (lately) Phineas and Ferb. </p>
      <p>One of the great advantages I can see from getting a Web Frontend Certificate, and pursuing a bachelor's degree after that, is that I will be able to work from home while raising my kids. The second great advantage I can see is that I am setting an example for my daughters of the importance of getting an education, choosing what they want to do and what they want to be--professionally and otherwise--, and finding satisfaction in working toward those goals. I'm looking forward to being able to bring in an income that my family can use to bless our lives and the lives of others. One of my lifelong goals is to build enough wealth that I can act on all of my generous impulses and give back to those who are less fortunate. Here's to success!</p>
