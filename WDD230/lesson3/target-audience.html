              backpack. Her and her older kids wear baseball caps from a
              sporting goods store. She wants to have a fun challenge in a place
              where she can keep track of her kids. She wears tank tops, likes
              rock climbing when she can find a babysitter. She is in her
              mid-30s. She uses her phone for the weather app to check if she
              needs a jacket or a hat for her morning run, and for the music
              app, and for Instagram where she shares her active life and
              stories about her kids.

              body-builders and Jeeping on Instagram and occasionally gets on
